You are working at a lower league football stadium and you've been tasked with automating the scoreboard.

The referee will shout out the score, you have already set up the voice recognition module which turns the ref's voice into a string, but the spoken score needs to be converted into a pair for the scoreboard!

e.g. "The score is four nil" should return [4,0]

Either teams score has a range of 0-9, and the ref won't say the same string every time e.g. 

E 
"new score: two three"
  
"two two"
  
"Arsenal just conceded another goal, two nil"

"The score now is five nil"

"five seven"

"The buccaneers just scored a touchdown the score now is seven three"

D 
string 
array 
if 

A 
1. A ref is going to be out on the field saying the score the program has to output his 
voice into a string and turn into a pair of numbers representing the score

2. declare new string of refs voice score 
3. range of score is 0-9 for each team 
4. nil = 0 
5. one = 1, two = 2, three = 3, four 4, five = 5, six = 6, seven = 7, eight = 8, nine = 9. 
6. string of "score is four nil" should return an array [4,0]
